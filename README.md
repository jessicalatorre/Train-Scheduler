# Train-Scheduler
This practical application uses Firebase to host arrival and departure data for each train, so station staff are better prepared before arrivals and the minutes away countdown is displayed to commuters and travelers. 

The app provides up-to-date information about trains, including their names and how many minutes until the next arrival to the station. It does so by retrieving the information then using the Moment.js library.

# How It Works
Station managers can quickly type in the details of incoming trains, so they can have a running list of train names with a corresponding minutes away column. This allows them to prepare platforms and ticketing booths, as well as schedule staff breaks--before each train arrives. 

If managers chooses to display the minutes away count down, those eagerly awaiting for their trains also have a more accurate count-down, as long as the manager refresh the page on display.
